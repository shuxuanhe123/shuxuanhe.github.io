# **ABOUT ME**

Hi, I'm Shuxuan! I am a B.S. graduate in Business Administration with a minor in Data Analytics from Chapman University. What excites me most about data analysis is the process of uncovering patterns and translating raw information into meaningful insights that can drive impactful decisions. 

During my academic journey and internships, I’ve explored the power of data in different fields—whether I was coordinating talent acquisition efforts at Futronics Corporation, where I managed applicant data for over 500 candidates, or conducting market research at Cybertegic Inc., where my analyses contributed to a 15% improvement in cost efficiency and a 20% revenue increase. These experiences reinforced my belief that data can do more than inform decisions—it can reshape strategies and create meaningful connections with stakeholders.

Looking forward, I’m excited to focus my career on data analytics, using my skills to solve complex challenges, improve organizational processes, and tell meaningful stories through data.

# **Projects**

### Analyzing Twitter Sentiment for Airlines 

**Goal:** To improve the operational effectiveness and consumer happiness of airline firms by examining the sentiments expressed in tweets.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of tweets mentioning various airlines. The dataset included tweet IDs, airline sentiments, confidence levels, reasons for negative sentiments, retweet counts, tweet creation dates, and user timelines. The project involved loading the data into Tableau, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) through interactive visualizations, analyzing sentiment patterns, and implementing predictive analysis for airline sentiments.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, sentiment analysis, data visualization, interactive dashboards.

**Technology:** Tableau

**Results:**  The analysis revealed that United Airlines is the most discussed airline, while Southwest Airlines has the highest occurrence of positive sentiments. The insights highlighted the main causes of negative sentiments, such as late flights and customer service issues. The findings were visualized through various interactive dashboards, allowing for a deeper understanding of sentiment distribution across different airlines and time zones. The project provided actionable insights to improve customer service and operational strategies for airlines.

### Strategizing for Spotify: Enhancing Playlist Placement Opportunities 
**Code:** [`Strategizing for Spotify: Enhancing Playlist Placement Opportunities.R`](https://github.com/cnguyen180/CaitlinN-data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/NewMusicFriday.R)

**Goal:** To provide evidence-based strategies to increase the likelihood of artists' songs being featured on Spotify's "New Music Friday" playlist.

**Description:** Examines the factors influencing song placements on Spotify's "New Music Friday" playlist, offering strategic insights and recommendations for artists and music labels to enhance their visibility and streaming performance on Spotify.

**Skills:** data analysis, statistical reasoning, strategic thinking, presentation proficiency, visual data representation, and project management

**Technology:** R

**Results:** Show that artists with higher solo streaming numbers and those experiencing a surge in daily streams are more likely to have their songs featured on Spotify's "New Music Friday." This suggests a focus on building a strong solo streaming presence and leveraging current streaming success are key strategies for playlist inclusion.

### How Analytics Define the New Age of Blockbusters
**Code:** [`How Analytics Define the New Age of Blockbusters`](https://github.com/shuxuanhe123/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/blockbuster.R)

**Goal:** Utilize advanced machine learning to predict high-grossing movies for the upcoming season and estimate potential revenue.

**Description** Analyze historical movie data, perform EDA and data cleaning, and apply machine learning models. The objective is to provide actionable insights and recommendations on likely successful movies for the new season, culminating in an internal hackathon presentation.

**Skills:** Data analysis, machine learning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, data preprocessing, hypothesis formulation, statistical analysis, economic reasoning, data visualization, client communication, presenting findings

**Technology:** R

### Predicting Customer Spending in the Apparel Industry: Insights from Linear and Polynomial Regression Models
**Code:** [`Predicting Customer Spending in the Apparel Industry: Insights from Linear and Polynomial Regression Models`](https://github.com/shuxuanhe123/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/clothesanalyst.ipynb)

**Goal:** The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate predictive models to forecast annual customer spending at a clothing business using various customer-related characteristics. This will enable the business to make informed decisions that improve marketing strategies, inventory management, and overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Description** Analyze customer-related data, including demographic and behavioral characteristics, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply regression models. The objective is to develop accurate predictive models that help the business understand and forecast customer spending patterns, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. The project involves building and comparing linear and polynomial regression models, evaluating their performance, and presenting findings in a detailed report.

**Skills:** Data analysis, machine learning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, data preprocessing, hypothesis formulation, statistical analysis, economic reasoning, data visualization, client communication, presenting findings

**Technology:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Plotnine, Statsmodels

### **Predicting Song Popularity and Genre**
Goal: To predict a song’s popularity, genre, and its likelihood of becoming a hit (with over 1 million streams) based on various song-related features.

Description: This project analyzed a dataset of songs, focusing on features such as lyrics, danceability, loudness, and acousticness. The analysis included applying beta regression, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering, linear regression with ElasticNet, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns in song performance. The objective was to help record labels assess the characteristics of music that performed well and guide their artist signing decisions.

Skills: Data preprocessing, regression modeling, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature analysis.

Results: The project identified key song features correlated with high popularity and genre trends, providing actionable insights for predicting future hits and understanding song attributes that influence streaming success.

### **Diet Analysis: Predicting Weight Change**

**Goal:** To analyze how demographic and lifestyle factors influence weight changes and identify key predictors of weight fluctuations over time.

**Description:** This project utilized a dataset of 100 participants from Kaggle, containing information such as daily caloric intake, BMR, physical activity levels, stress, and sleep quality. The analysis involved building linear regression models to predict weight change, clustering participants by lifestyle features using K-means, and exploring how sleep quality and stress levels impact physical activity. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also applied to assess whether dimensionality reduction improved predictive performance.

**Skills:** Linear regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, supervised modeling, data preprocessing, visualization.

**Results:** The linear regression model identified BMR and current weight as the most significant predictors of weight change. Clustering revealed distinct lifestyle-based groups, though with moderate separation, and the supervised model highlighted the correlation between poor sleep quality and higher stress levels affecting physical activity. The PCA model demonstrated effective dimensionality reduction, retaining over 90% of the data variance while achieving a comparable MSE to the original variables.
