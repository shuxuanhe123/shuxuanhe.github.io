# **ABOUT ME**

Hi, I'm Shuxuan! I am a Bachelor of Science graduate in Business Administration with a minor in Data Analytics from Chapman University. What excites me most about data analysis is the process of uncovering patterns and translating raw information into meaningful insights that can drive impactful decisions. 

During my academic journey and internships, I’ve explored the power of data in different fields—whether I was coordinating talent acquisition efforts at Futronics Corporation, where I managed applicant data for over 500 candidates, or conducting market research at Cybertegic Inc., where my analyses contributed to a 15% improvement in cost efficiency and a 20% revenue increase. These experiences reinforced my belief that data can do more than inform decisions—it can reshape strategies and create meaningful connections with stakeholders.

Looking forward, I’m excited to focus my career on data analytics, using my skills to solve complex challenges, improve organizational processes, and tell meaningful stories through data.

# **Projects**
Predicting Song Popularity and Genre
Goal: To predict a song’s popularity, genre, and its likelihood of becoming a hit (with over 1 million streams) based on various song-related features.

Description: This project analyzed a dataset of songs, focusing on features such as lyrics, danceability, loudness, and acousticness. The analysis included applying beta regression, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering, linear regression with ElasticNet, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns in song performance. The objective was to help record labels assess the characteristics of music that performed well and guide their artist signing decisions.

Skills: Data preprocessing, regression modeling, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature analysis.

Results: The project identified key song features correlated with high popularity and genre trends, providing actionable insights for predicting future hits and understanding song attributes that influence streaming success.

### **Diet Analysis: Predicting Weight Change**

**Goal:** To analyze how demographic and lifestyle factors influence weight changes and identify key predictors of weight fluctuations over time.

**Description:** This project utilized a dataset of 100 participants from Kaggle, containing information such as daily caloric intake, BMR, physical activity levels, stress, and sleep quality. The analysis involved building linear regression models to predict weight change, clustering participants by lifestyle features using K-means, and exploring how sleep quality and stress levels impact physical activity. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also applied to assess whether dimensionality reduction improved predictive performance.

**Skills:** Linear regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, supervised modeling, data preprocessing, visualization.

**Results:** The linear regression model identified BMR and current weight as the most significant predictors of weight change. Clustering revealed distinct lifestyle-based groups, though with moderate separation, and the supervised model highlighted the correlation between poor sleep quality and higher stress levels affecting physical activity. The PCA model demonstrated effective dimensionality reduction, retaining over 90% of the data variance while achieving a comparable MSE to the original variables.
